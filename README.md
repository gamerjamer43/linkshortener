```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gamerjamer43/linkshortener.git
   cd linkshortener
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv  # venv if you want it
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # requirements.txt not 100% necessary
   ```

3. **Configure**

   * Copy and rename `example.env` to `.env`, then edit whatever values you wanna mess with.
   * Populate `alloweddomains.txt` with one domain per line (e.g. `example.com`). I put a list in there for you to start with of some commonly used base domains.

4. **Run locally**

   ```bash
   export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
   flask run
   ```

   Or with Gunicorn for production:

   ```bash
   gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 wsgi:app
   ```

## Usage

* Send a `POST` to `/shorten` with JSON:

  ```json
  {
    "url": "https://example.com/some/long/path"
  }
  ```

  Returns:

  ```json
  {
    "short_url": "https://short.yourdomain.com/abc123"
  }
  ```

* Accessing `https://short.yourdomain.com/abc123` will redirect to the original URL.

## Contributing

This project is currently **work in progress**.
Not quite sure WHY you would wanna contribute, but shit, I am welcome to it. Hit me up, my socials/links are available on my profile.

## Planned Features
* Full security, I kinda just made this functional for right now. Lacking full sanitization, a blocklist, 
* Accounts allowing you to store links, and/or allowing you to have an editable ephermeral page that shows before redirects to your links.
* I can't think of what else to add because I don't want overhead. So we'll just say I'm adding... **more**, for right now at least.
